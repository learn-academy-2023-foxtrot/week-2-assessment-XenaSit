# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Oh No! i actually thought they were the same. Well here goes nothing. When we pass in the method we give method the prenthaasis where the argument should go, but wait, this is where we enter the parameters. So i hope this is correct, the function takes in argument and the method takes in parameters.

Researched answer: Alright. I was not too far off. They are used interchangably when passed into a function. However there is tiny difference. PARAMETER is one of the variables that are passed into a function, it is a part of the function definition. && ARGUMENT is data you pass into method's parameter. And to unravel the knot. Method vs Function. FUNCTION is independant and doesn't need an object, can pass or return data, && METHOD is linked with an object, operates data within the class. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: finally i know something for a definite sure (VALUE, INDEX, ARRAY). this is built in structure. So if you want to pass array it is required that you pass in the value and the index, if you want just the index, you have to pass in value. And value is first, so always got to got to got to have the value.

Researched answer: ""I know that I know nothing"" -Socrates. Yes. These quastions humble pretty quickly. So .map () is a method that takes in a function as a parameter... First parameter is required and it is the function that applyed to each element, and Second parameter is optional and it is a function to be used as the this keyword.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map is the forloop that loops through values and applys whatever function to each element, and filter loops through the values and checks if it is truthy or falsy and spits out a new array with truthy statements.

Researched answer: map and filter both create new arrays, only map changes each element and filter removs elements that do not belong.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: yes! yes! Iteration is a process by .map or a forloop of going through each value within the given array. By iterating it takes value at each index and looks at it with a function to change it. 

Researched answer: operates on every array item.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: 3 quastions too late. but Function can return and pass data without requiring an object. Method is linked to the object and operates within a class.

Researched answer: Method is assosiated with the an object, while the function is not. All methods can be functions, not all functions can be methods.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is something that is covered. like key and values within the object or a function within the class.

Researched answer: A variable can be used before it is declared. Moving declaration, functions, classes at the top of the scope {} prior to exicuution of code. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: three dots before the var. Often used in combination with destructuring. Concatinate 2 arrays in a simpler way. Good for Refactoring!

2. React state: it is, simply put, an object that contayn keys and values that belong to a COMPONENT and are easy to modify.

3. DOM events: Document Object Model Event. writin in camelCase. Written {withing the curly braces}. Event can be triggered by user or be system generated. (The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event. - i actually am not getting this part.)
